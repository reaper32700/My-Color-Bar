# My-Color-Bar

TO access this app you need to have the software called android studio.
Open this file to the android studio or create a activity with the empty activity layout and copy the code.
After copying/ opening the file just click run at the top that it looks like a play button on youtube.
before running make sure the phone is connect to the device used to run the app.
After running open the app in your phone.
If you saw 3 lines with the circle in the center or shall i say RGB, just drag them and you can see the color and the hexadecimal color code.
And that's all for my app.
